# No longer developed
This project was created to tinker with ideas aiming to create a small MVVM framework similar to [Knockout.js], but using modern libraries and techniques, primarily [rxjs].

There have been a few interesting ideas here but *this project has run its course*. I am no longer performing any development toward it, instead favouring [React] and [Redux].

[rxjs]: https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com
[React]: https://reactjs.org
[Redux]: https://redux.js.org
